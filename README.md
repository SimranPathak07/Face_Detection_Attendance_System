# Attendance_System
A Face Detection Attendance System is an automated system that uses facial recognition technology to track and record attendance in a more efficient and secure manner.<br>
Instead of manually signing in, individuals can have their faces scanned by a camera, and the system detects, recognizes, and logs their attendance.

# Key Points
<b>1. </b>Face Detection: The system identifies faces in real-time using computer vision algorithms. Common methods include using Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces in images or video streams.<br>
<b>2. </b>Face Recognition: After detecting a face, the system compares it to a database of known individuals to recognize who the person is.<br>
<b>3. </b>Attendance Logging: Once the face is recognized, the system logs the attendance of the identified person in  a file (e.g., CSV or Excel), recording the time and date.<br>
<b>4. </b>Automated & Paperless: It eliminates the need for physical attendance sheets or cards, offering a faster, more convenient method for both students and employees.<br>
<b>5. </b>Security & Privacy: Since it uses biometrics (the unique characteristics of a person's face), it provides a more secure form of attendance tracking, preventing proxy attendance or manipulation.<br>
